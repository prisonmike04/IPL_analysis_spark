# IPL Data Analysis using Apache Spark 🏏
The notebook provides a detailed step-by-step process for setting up the environment, loading data, and performing transformations and analyses using Apache Spark.

 In this project, I analyzed IPL data by building a data pipeline using Apache Spark. The main focus was on writing Spark code and using various functions to perform data transformations. Let me walk you through the steps I followed:

Environment Setup 🌐:
First, I set up the environment. This involved installing the necessary software and configuring my system to work with Apache Spark and Java. I also set up environment variables to ensure everything ran smoothly.

Spark Session Initialization ⚙️:
Next, I created a Spark session with specific configurations. This helped optimize performance and manage resources efficiently, which was crucial for handling large datasets like the IPL data.

Data Loading 📂:
I then loaded the IPL data from CSV files into Spark DataFrames. This made it easy to manipulate and analyze the data.

Data Transformation 🔄:
I performed various data transformations to clean and preprocess the IPL data. This included filtering, aggregating, and joining operations to prepare the data for analysis.

Analysis with Spark SQL 🧠:
I utilized Spark SQL to perform complex queries and data analysis on the IPL dataset. Spark SQL provided an interface for executing SQL queries on Spark data, allowing me to leverage the power of SQL for data analysis. I conducted operations like selecting specific columns, filtering rows based on conditions, aggregating data to calculate statistics, and joining multiple DataFrames to combine relevant information.

Data Storage with AWS S3 ☁️:
I used AWS S3 for storing the processed data, ensuring scalability and reliability. AWS S3 provided a robust storage solution where I saved intermediate and final results of the data pipeline. This involved configuring Spark to interact with S3 and uploading the cleaned and analyzed data to S3 buckets for long-term storage and easy accessibility.

Visualization 📈:
Finally, I generated visualizations to effectively present the analyzed data, making the insights easier to understand.
